						<p class="h-h4">"If I had the opportunity to go through Academic Coaching as a freshman entering college instead of a senior exiting it, I believe my college experience would have been radically different. In a very short period of time I thought more critically about my direction and pursuits than I ever had before and really came up with an action plan for attaining the goals I have for my future. I think that I could have avoided a lot of stress and worry over choosing my course of study and what I needed to accomplish to be able to present myself as an asset to future employers if I had gone through Academic Coaching at the start of college. The experience gave me a lot of confidence and drive to take control of creating my own opportunities for my future and pursuing my career aspirations upon graduation."</p>
