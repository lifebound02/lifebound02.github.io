		<p>Ulcca Joshi Hansen has worked in education for nearly 20 years, assisting government agencies, schools and educators as they shape their work to meet the individual needs of all students.  After earning her PhD from Oxford University and her JD from Harvard Law School, Ulcca served in a range of roles working with students and teachers in K-12 and higher education settings, as well as on federal and state policy.  Most recently, she worked with PEBC and the Boettcher Teacher Residency training and supporting teachers in creating inquiry-based classrooms where students can be empowered as both learners and people.

Her work is aimed at supporting educators, parents and students in crafting educational experiences that identify and nurture the unique potential of each individual student.  She is currently working on a book making the case that the future of smart looks far different than todayâ€™s narrow definitions of academic success would suggest.

Truman Scholar, a British Marshall Scholar, and a Paul and Daisy Soros Fellow. </p>
